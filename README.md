# Data science projectsðŸš€
My personal (public) project to share tools and tips about Data Science and Python

## What do you need to be a great data scientist?
1. Critical Thinking (like every scientist)
2. Python, R, Julia (at least intermediate level), some C or C++
3. Statistics 
4. Linear Algebra
5. Differential Equations
6. Creativity
7. Good Learning Techniques
8. Machine Learning
9. Deep Learning
10. Big Data Analysis (Spark, Map-Reduce principle, Ray)
11. ETL Pipeline + DataSet generation
12. ...one or two topic to specialize your skills (i.e. Autonomous Driving, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Finance)

## Goals
- [x] Simple Reinforcement Learning (or other online learning system)
  - [x] Q-Table
  - [x] Deep Q-Learning (Experience Replay) 
- [x] GUI basics (QT, ImGUI, ...)
- [ ] Physical Simulations
- [ ] BioInformatics
- [ ] Effective Data Visualizations (Seaborn, DataViz, ...)
- [x] One simple and effective tool to improve Computer Vision accuracy (No Flatten Information etc...) like [this](https://github.com/ansh941/MnistSimpleCNN)
- [ ] Explainable AI
- [ ] Edge AI (TinyML, Raspberry, ...)
- [ ] Transformers (NLP and Text-to-Image)
  - [ ] Visual
  - [ ] Stable Diffusion
  - [ ] Mistral   
- [ ] Business Process Automation (PowerBI, Zapier, etc...)
- [ ] RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
