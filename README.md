# Data science projectsðŸš€
My personal (public) project to share tools and tips about Data Science and Python

## What do you need to be a **great** data scientist?
1. Critical Thinking (like every scientist)
2. Python, R, Julia (at least intermediate level), some C or C++
3. Statistics
4. Linear Algebra
5. Differential Equation
6. Creativity
7. Good Learning Techniques
8. Machine Learning
9. Deep Learning
10. Big Data Analysis (Spark, map reduce principle, Ray)
11. ...one to micro/macro topic to specialize your skills (i.e. Autonomous Driving, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision)


## Goals
- [ ] Simple Reinforcement Learning (or other online learning system)
- [ ] Physical Simulation / Biological
- [ ] Effective Data Visualizations (Seaborn)
- [ ] One simple and effective tool to improve Computer Vision accuracy (No Flatten Information etc...) like [this](https://github.com/ansh941/MnistSimpleCNN)
- [ ] Explainable AI
- [ ] Edge AI
- [ ] Transformers (NLP and Text-to-Image)
